A-E will be required to develop naming and numbering for newly developed schematics, generally based off existing standards set within a database.\\n3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria ‘a through e’ are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors. Criteria f and g are secondary and will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that\\nare essentially technically equal.\\na. Specialized experience and technical competence in:\\n1) Designing facilities for a contingency environment to “initial” and “temporary” standards IAW UFC 1-201-01 “Non-Permanent DoD Facilities in Support of Military Operations”. Familiarity with the Army Facilities Components System (AFCS) and Joint Construction Management System (JCMS), and familiarity with the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Design Management System (DMS) will be given greater consideration. Evaluation will be based on project descriptions in Section F of the SF 330.\\n2) Quality management procedures. The basis of the evaluation will be the description of the firm’s quality management procedures in Section H of the SF 330. A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but will be required subsequent to award of the contract.\\n3) Leading design charrettes and conducting customer reviews. Evaluation will be based on project descriptions in Section F of the SF 330.\\nFor sub-criteria a.1 and a.3, the basis of evaluation will be the project descriptions in Section F of the SF 330. For sub-criteria a.2, the basis of the evaluation will be the description of the firm’s quality management procedures in Section H of the SF 330. Sub-criteria are in descending order of importance, a.3 is less important than a.2 and a.2 is less important than a.1.\\nb. Professional Qualifications: Responding firms should demonstrate the\\nprofessional qualifications in these key disciplines:\\n(1) Project manager (2) Architect (3) Structural engineer (4) Mechanical engineer (5) Electrical engineer (6) Civil engineer\\nAdditional disciplines required as part of the contract that will not be evaluated include: Data modeler (i.e. data entry technician).\\nThe basis of evaluation will be information provided in section E of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall include a matrix in Section G showing experience of the proposed lead disciplines on the projects listed in Section F of the SF 330. The qualifications (education, professional registration, certifications) and experience (overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm) will be considered. Qualified professionals with active duty military or civilian experience in a contingency environment will be given greater consideration. All disciplines are equal in\\nimportance. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. The lead personnel for each discipline should be clearly identified in section E. Only one resume (the lead for that discipline) will be evaluated for each discipline.\\nc. Past Performance\\nRecent and relevant past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be considered. The Contract Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting a SF 330. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant teaming partners/subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered. Significant teaming partners/subcontractors are those firms whose qualifications are being used in Section F projects. In addition to CPARS, the board may seek information on past performance from other sources. If no recent or relevant performance record is available, or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror will receive a neutral evaluation. A neutral rating is considered neither a positive nor negative.\\nd. Knowledge of local conditions. Not used.\\ne. Capacity to initiate work and complete within the time parameters of the\\nproject.\\nThe evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in the following key disciplines: project manager, architects, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, civil engineers, structural engineers. The evaluation will look at numbers listed in Part II of the SF330 to evaluate the overall capacity of the team. Include a Part II form for each firm that is part of the proposed team.\\nSecondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.\\nf. Volume of DoD AE contract awards in the last 12 months.\\nResponding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications,\\naward dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD AE contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD AE contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.\\n4. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform\\nthis work must submit one Standard Form (SF) 330 electronic copy using the instructions for the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) below no later than 1:00 PM Central Standard Time on 30 May, 2024. Copies of the SF 330, Part II, for the prime firm and all consultants should be included in the SF 330. Only one SF 330 Part I for the team as a whole should be included. Include the firm's Unique Entity ID (UEI) and CAGE CODE identification numbers in SF 330, Part I, Section B, Block 5.\\nA maximum of five (5) projects for the proposed team (including joint ventures and teaming partners) may be shown in Section F. A “project” is defined as work performed at one site or a single installation. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) will not be considered a “project” for the purposes of evaluation. Individual Task Order contracts awarded from an IDC contract will only be considered as a single project, regardless of the number of facilities and/or the range of the scope of work (i.e. a single Task Order contract cannot be submitted as multiple projects for the submission requirements in this synopsis). If the offeror provides a specific task order as a project, it should provide the base contract number and the task order number for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as a project, it should provide the contract number for reference purposes. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of design completed (for instance, preparation of design- build package; 100% design; etc.), dates of completion for design and construction, and project category type (new/ renovation). Clearly cite whether the experience is that of the prime (or joint venture), consultant or an individual for each project in Section F. Work cited that is experience of the prime (or joint venture) from an office other than that identified in Section C should be so labeled. Projects (or phases of projects) with design completed before May 2018 will not be considered. Projects (or phases of projects) for which design is not complete will not be considered.\\nFirms may demonstrate additional experience with projects similar to the requirements listed in section 2 by providing a project summary list or matrix within Section H. The additional projects will not be evaluated but will be utilized for future task order selections and minimize the need for requesting supplemental information. The project summary list or matrix is limited to 2-pages within Section H and projects must meet the “project” requirements indicated in section 4.\\nInterviews will be held with the most highly qualified firms. Interviews will be conducted telephonically after determination of the most highly qualified firms.\\nInterested firms are reminded, per FAR 36.606, that subcontractors, outside associates, and consultants whose qualifications are utilized for selection and negotiated for award may not be changed without obtaining the Contracting Officer’s written consent before making any substitutions.\\nThe SF 330 should have a total page limitation of 150 pages with Section H limited to twenty (20) pages. Each project in Section F should be limited to two (2) pages; Part II is excluded from the 150-page limit. Graphic sheets, like organization charts, of 11\\ninches X 17 inches will be counted as a single page. Tabs do not count against the page count limit, but information contained on divider tabs will not be evaluated. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 point font.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services will be procured in accordance with (IAW)\\n40 USC Chapter 11 Selection of Architects and Engineers (formerly known as Brooks\\nAct) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 to provide planning,\\ndesign, and engineering during construction primarily in support of the Civil Works\\nmission area within the SWG boundary and may be used for similar horizontal\\nengineering projects to support the Military and Interagency and International Support\\n(IIS) missions within the SWD area of responsibility (AOR). Capacity could be\\ntransferred outside the SWD AOR for high priority projects or emerging programs if\\ncapacity in other regions within the continental U.S. is inadequate.\\nThis announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E\\nservices with a total shared capacity of $900M and includes a target of six (6)\\nUnrestricted A-E Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) and a target of six (6) separate\\nIDCs reserved for Small Business. The Government reserves the right to award more or\\nless than the target number of IDCs within the Unrestricted and Small Business IDC\\ngroups depending on the number of contractors considered highly qualified IAW Brooks\\nAct procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for\\nthis action is 541330 that has a small business size standard of $25.5 million.\\nAll firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are\\nsubmitting.\\nFirms should state the words UNRESTRICTED or SMALL BUSINESS after the\\nsolicitation number in PART I, Block A.3. of the SF330. As this is a single MATOC,\\nsmall business firms need only submit a single SF330.\\nSelection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon\\nthe professional qualifications necessary to perform the required services. Only firms\\nconsidered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract IAW 40 USC Chapter 11\\nSelection of Architects and Engineers statute, FAR Subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery\\nContracts, FAR Subpart 36.6 and DFARS Subpart 236.6 Architect-Engineer Services.\\nMultiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a\\nperiod not to exceed a total of eight (8) years, which includes a two (2) year base period\\nand three (3) two (2)-year options with the ability to extend the contract for a period of up to six (6) months, if necessary, under FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual\\ntask orders with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed\\n$900,000,000.00 over the eight-year life of the MATOC.\\nThe Government will issue a rate sheet to the most highly qualified offerors and will\\nnegotiate fair and reasonable prices once, with an escalation rate to be applied every 12\\nmonths. There is no intent to include an economic price adjustment clause. Task Orders\\nwill be issued IAW USACE policy on procedures for the selection of Task Orders on A-E\\nMATOC IDCs. IAW FAR 19.504(c), all task orders, regardless of dollar value, will be\\nreviewed for a set-aside under the Small Business Reserve. Consistent with FAR\\n16.504(c)(1)(ii)(A), the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has determined that it is in\\nthe Government’s best interest that at all times during the term of the contract, there\\nremain an adequate number of IDC holders eligible to compete for Task Orders. Over\\ntime, the total number of IDC holders may fluctuate due to various reasons, to include\\nindustry consolidation, significant changes in the marketplace, significant advances in\\ntechnology, general economic conditions, or other reasons. Recognizing this, the PCO\\nintends to periodically review the total number of IDC holders and determine whether it\\nwould be in the Government’s best interest to initiate on-ramp procedures to add new\\ncontractors to the MATOC pool consistent with the original target number of IDC\\nholders.\\nTask Order types include Firm-Fixed Price, Cost-Plus Award Fee, Cost-Plus Fixed Fee,\\nTime and Materials, and Labor Hours. Task Order selection procedures will comply with\\nSection 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. As this\\nMATOC includes a Small Business reserve pool, the qualifications of the reserve pool\\nmust first be considered for task order requirements. Firms will be required to\\ndemonstrate an acceptable accounting system. For clarification, this is NOT requesting\\nCost Accounting Standards (CAS) compliance from FAR part 30 or 48 CFR 9903.201.\\nThis is a separate but related requirement for an acceptable accounting system as\\nrequired by FAR parts 16 and 31 and specifically defined by DFARS 252.242-7006. All\\nofferors must have an acceptable accounting system to be awarded a contract. The\\nGovernment will not review or evaluate the accounting system; however, the following\\nitems will be accepted as evidence of an acceptable accounting system. A letter from a third party commercially recognized auditing firm within the last 12 months stating the accounting system is acceptable as required by DFARS 252.242-\\n7006; or A letter from a third party commercially recognized accounting firm within the last 12 months stating the accounting system is acceptable as required by DFARS 252.242- 7006; or\\nAn audit of the accounting system from the Federal Government Cognizant Audit\\nAgency; (NOTE: if DCAA audit has been performed/approved over 12 months ago, a\\nstatement that the accounting has not changed since being approved would be\\nsufficient).\\nAll firms will be required, at the base contract level and subsequently for each\\napplicable task order (other than Firm-Fixed Price), to have a certified cost accounting\\nsystem that will permit timely development of all necessary cost data IAW FAR Part 16.\\nPrior to award of the base IDC, all firms will be required to provide a current\\naudit/report/findings/letter and point of contact with phone number or e-mail address\\nfrom the offeror’s Federal Government Cognizant Audit Agency or any commercially\\nrecognized auditing or accounting firm stating that the offeror’s accounting system is\\nadequate for accumulating costs under the applicable Government contracts, if\\navailable. If it has been over twelve (12) months since the accounting system has been\\ndesignated as adequate, the offeror shall also provide a statement that the accounting\\nsystem has not changed since being approved.\\nPROJECT INFORMATION: A-E services for this contract will be used to provide all\\ntypes of civil works related engineering areas, such as: flood damage and risk\\nreduction; floodplain modeling; coastal erosion; storm damage risk reduction and beach\\nnourishment; shoreline and stream bank erosion protection; shallow and deep draft\\nnavigation; environmental and ecosystem habitat restoration; comprehensive watershed\\nevaluations; infrastructure; and multi-purpose water resources projects. The capabilities\\nof A-E firms would include comprehensive planning, technical analysis, engineering,\\ndesign, and engineering during construction. Services include data collection,\\ngeotechnical investigations, surveying, preliminary studies through feasibility report\\ndevelopment; engineering design through detailed plans, specifications, and design\\nanalysis/design documentation report preparation; alternate delivery method (i.e.\\ndesign-build, progressive design-build, and early contractor involvement) request for\\nproposal development; value engineering; technical and biddability, constructability,\\noperability, environmental, and sustainability (BCOES) reviews; documentation for right\\nof entry and right of way; and engineering during construction for both inland and\\ncoastal civil works or similar horizontal projects for the military and IIS programs. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria A thru E are primary. Criterion F and G are secondary and will only\\nbe used as a tiebreaker among technically equal firms. A. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: A maximum of ten (10) relevant projects of the prime, the subcontractor(s), or both, will be reviewed in PART I,\\nSection F of the SF330. Submitted projects shall be at least 50% completed within the\\npast fifteen (15) years from the date of issuance of the synopsis. Of these ten (10)\\nprojects, the Prime must have performed and completed a minimum of six (6) projects\\n(as the prime contractor, or designer of record). Joint Venture (JV) submissions shall\\nalso provide a minimum of six (6) projects; however, if the JV does not have the\\nminimum projects as a JV Offeror, then the Managing Venturer shall supplement to\\nmeet the minimum requirement of six (6) projects. Any project submitted by the JV as\\nprevious experience performed as the offeror, shall count toward the managing venturer\\nexperience.\\nUse no more than two (2) pages per project. A project is defined as a project performed\\nunder a single, stand-alone contract and/or a single task order issued under an existing\\nIDC unless the project included multiple phases and was issued under more than one\\ncontractual order. It shall be noted that an IDC is not a project and will not be in\\ncompliance with the requirement. Do not combine multiple task orders unrelated to a\\nstand-alone project to create a single project example. The contract number or IDC\\nnumber and individual task order number associated with the project in the title must be\\nincluded for each of the projects. If the project is not 100% complete, note the current\\npercentage and estimated date when the project will be completed for each contract\\nand/or task order. All projects shall demonstrate a performance as the prime and/or\\ndesigner of record (DOR) and include the percentage of work self-performed by the\\nprime and subcontractor(s) for each contract and/or task order. Percentages shall be\\nlisted by firm individually. Preference will be given to projects performed as a prime\\ncontractor (or DOR) as opposed to subcontracted work. If proposing as a JV, include\\nthe percentage of work self- performed by each JV member. In the case of JV\\nsubmissions, preference will be given to JVs who have previously performed work\\ntogether as the prime contractor. Unique Entity Identification (UEI) and Commercial and\\nGovernment Entity (CAGE) codes for previous JVs shall be clearly indicated in the past\\nperformance, if UEI and CAGE codes are not provided, this experience will not be\\nconsidered to support a history of working together.\\nFive (5) of the ten (10) projects shall be 100% complete design of which three (3) of the\\nfive (5) projects shall be 100% complete design with engineering during construction\\nthat specifically address the areas of emphasis listed below. Offerors shall ensure that\\nthe total combination of projects submitted address all five areas of emphasis. Offerors\\nshall annotate when individual projects address more than one area of emphasis. Areas of Emphasis: (1) navigation structures (lock and dams, floodgates, etc.);\\n(2) floodwalls and closure structures;\\n(3) beaches, dunes, and coastal structures;\\n(4) dams and levees; and\\n(5) pump stations.\\nProjects for federal agencies, USACE, or associated with USACE (such as work-in-kind\\nfor non-federal sponsors) will be MORE relevant, when all other aspects of the scope\\nare considered equal. Projects performed for clients other than federal agencies or\\nUSACE may be relevant if they address the area of emphasis. Preference will be given\\nto prime offerors that demonstrate the capability to self-perform a greater number of the\\nareas of emphasis without teaming arrangements. Self-Performance requirements will\\nbe evaluated IAW FAR Subpart 19.5 at the task order level. Less Relevance will be\\ngiven to projects submitted by subcontractor teaming partners. Projects presented to\\naddress the areas of emphasis shall be presented and identified in the order listed\\nabove. The remaining five (5) projects shall follow the area of emphasis projects.\\nIn PART I, Section H, SF330 provide the following:\\nA narrative describing (1) the firm’s partnering philosophy to develop and sustain\\nrelationships between the A-E, Government, and stakeholders (2) the firm’s approach to\\nprovide exceptional delivery measured by expedited delivery, lower construction costs,\\nand quality assurance. (3) The narrative shall describe design quality management\\nprocedures that optimize quality, limit re-submittals of incomplete work, and increase efficiency of delivery. If submitting as JV Describe procedures that will limit the need for reviews across multiple firms while maintaining a quality product. (4) Describe\\nprevious experience between team members as structured in the offeror’s current\\nproposed teaming arrangement. For example, if proposing as a JV, previous experience\\nin a prime and subcontractor relationship would not be relevant and vice versa. (5)\\nDescribe procedures for financial management and task order management. If\\nsubmitting as a JV, describe procedures for administering multiple task orders across\\nthe JV arrangement and how modification of task order management would ensure\\nefficiency within the JV.

SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria ‘a’ through ‘e’ are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors. Criteria ‘f’ is secondary and will only be used as tiebreakers among firms that are essentially technically equal. A. Specialized experience and technical competence in:\\n1) Design of buildings and structures including new construction, repairs or renovation, and development of design criteria for design-build contracts. Firms will be evaluated on their design experience with the types of buildings, structures, and features of work listed in section 2.\\n2) Quality management procedures. Firms demonstrating a third-party certified (e.g. ISO 9001 or similar) quality management system will be given greater consideration. A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but will be required subsequent to award of the contract. For sub-criteria a.1, the basis of evaluation will be the project descriptions in Section F of the SF 330. The evaluation will consider characteristics such as: breadth, depth, and complexity of experience and delivery methods; incorporation of innovative solutions; sustainable design principles; and use of modeling tools. For sub-criteria a.2, the basis of the evaluation will be the description of the firm’s quality management procedures in Section H of the SF 330. Sub-criteria are in descending order of importance, a.2 is less important than a.1.\\nB. Professional Qualifications: Responding firms shall demonstrate the\\nprofessional qualifications in these key disciplines:\\n(1) Project manager (2) Architect (3) Structural engineer (4) Mechanical engineer (5) Electrical engineer\\n3\\n(6) Civil engineer (7) Fire protection engineer (8) Interior design (9) Geotechnical engineer (10) Cost Engineer/estimator\\nAdditional disciplines required as part of the contract that will not be evaluated include: community/urban planner, commissioning specialist, landscape architect, certified industrial hygienist, force protection specialist (physical security), force protection specialist (electronic security), aerial photography, archaeologist, historic architect, wildlife biologist, environmentalist, surveyor, geologist, GIS Specialist, Drill crew, and Drilling/Boring testing.\\nThe basis of evaluation will be information provided in Section E of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall include a matrix in Section G showing experience of the proposed lead disciplines on the projects listed in Section F of the SF 330. The qualifications (education, professional registration, certifications) and experience (overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm) will be considered. All disciplines are equal in importance. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. The lead personnel for each discipline should be clearly identified in Section E. Only one resume (the lead for that discipline) will be evaluated for each key discipline.\\nC. Past Performance\\nRecent and relevant past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be considered. The Contract Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting a SF 330. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant teaming partners/subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered. Significant teaming partners/subcontractors are those firms whose qualifications are being used in Section F projects. In addition to CPARS, the board may seek information on past performance from other sources. If no recent or relevant performance record is available, or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror will receive a neutral evaluation. A neutral rating is considered neither a positive nor negative.\\nD. Knowledge of local conditions:\\n1) Within Kansas and Missouri 2) Within NWD Military Boundary not including Kansas and Missouri (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin)\\n4\\nFor this criteria, d.1 is significantly more important than d.2. The evaluations for sub- criteria d.1 and d.2 will consider:\\n(a) climatic conditions (key disciplines: architect, mechanical engineer) (b) local construction methods, including geotechnical (key disciplines: civil engineer, structural engineer, geotechnical engineer) (c) local construction climate/market impact on cost estimating (cost engineer / estimator)\\nThe basis of the evaluation will be from the personal experience of the proposed personnel in the listed key disciplines located in Section E, including any additional key discipline resumes provided, and from the projects in Section F of the SF 330.\\nE. Capacity to initiate work and complete within the time parameters of the\\nproject.\\nThe evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in the following key disciplines: architect; mechanical engineer; electrical engineer; civil engineer; structural engineer. The evaluation will look at numbers listed in Part II of the SF330 to evaluate the overall capacity of the team. Include a Part II form for each firm that is part of the proposed team.\\nSECONDARY SELECTION CRITERIA. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tiebreaker among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation.\\nF. Volume of DoD A-E contract awards in the last 12 months.\\nResponding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.\\n4. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one Standard Form (SF) 330 electronic copy using the instructions for the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) below no later than 10:00 AM Central Standard Time 10 April 2024. Copies of the SF 330, Part II, for the prime firm and all consultants should be included in the SF 330. Only one SF 330 Part I for the team as a whole should be included. Include the firm's Unique Entity ID (UEI) and CAGE Code identification numbers in SF 330, Part I, Section B, Block 5. A maximum of ten (10) projects for the proposed team (including joint ventures and teaming partners) may be shown in Section F. A “project” is defined as work performed at one site or a single installation. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) will not be considered a “project” for the purposes of evaluation. Individual Task Order contracts\\n5\\nawarded from an IDC contract will only be considered as a single project, regardless of the number of facilities and/or the range of the scope of work (i.e. a single Task Order contract cannot be submitted as multiple projects for the submission requirements in this synopsis.) If the offeror provides a specific task order as a project, it should provide the base contract number and the task order number for reference purposes. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of design completed (for instance, preparation of design-build package; 100% design; etc.), dates of completion for design and construction, and project category type (new/renovation). Clearly cite whether the experience is that of the prime (or joint venture), consultant or an individual for each project in Section F. Work cited that is experience of the prime (or joint venture) from an office other than that identified in Section C should be so labeled. Projects (or phases of projects) with design completed before March 2018 will not be considered. Projects (or phases of projects) for which design is not complete will not be considered.\\nFirms may demonstrate additional experience with projects similar to the requirements listed in section 2 by providing a project summary list or matrix within Section H. The additional projects will not be evaluated but will be utilized for future task order selections and minimize the need for requesting supplemental information. The project summary list or matrix is limited to 2-pages within Section H and projects must meet the “project” requirements indicated in section 4. Projects should include the title, contract number, and brief scope description. No more than 50 additional projects may be presented within the 2-page limit.\\nInterviews will be held with the most highly qualified firms. Interviews will be conducted in person or telephonically after determination of the most highly qualified firms. Firms should anticipate interview requests will be sent within three weeks of the submittal date.\\nInterested firms are reminded, per FAR 36.606, that subcontractors, outside associates, and consultants whose qualifications are utilized for selection and negotiated for award may not be changed without obtaining the Contracting Officer’s written consent before making any substitutions.\\nThe SF 330 should have a total page limitation of 150 pages with Section H limited to twenty (20) pages. Each project in Section F should be limited to two (2) pages; Part II is excluded from the 150-page limit. Graphic sheets, like organization charts, of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as a single page. Tabs do not count against the page count limit, but information contained on divider tabs will not be evaluated. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11-point font. Note: this is not a request for proposal. Submit electronic responses utilizing the instructions in section 6 below.\\n5.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND RELEVANCE TO THIS CONTRACT (Include scope, size, and cost)\\nBrief Project Overview The project was a 35% design and repair of two visitor quarters to bring the facili- ties up to current AFI and Code standards and improve the aesthetics and utiliza- tion of the lodging units. The scope of work involved the renovation of the exist- ing residential R1 sleeping rooms (visitors’ quarters) contained within Building 265 and Building 404 to be within the existing unit footprints while maintaining the existing building vertical access points. The facility is used for short term lodging for visiting military personnel at PSFB.\\nAerial View of Visitors Quarters.

A Project Planning Document Charrette (PPDC) was conducted to gather/confirm scope requirements and criteria relevant to the RTI and support facilities, establish a revised DD Form 1390/91 with exceptions to criteria, and develop Master Plan Concepts. Analysis of the preliminary parametric estimate resulted in a phased construction strategy, which is not part of the DoD Pricing Guide. Jacobs further developed the DoD Pricing Guide model to include the as- sociated costs of phasing the construction. Jacobs determined that the project needed to be phased to fit within the programmed amount. Each phase needed to be “complete and useable” for the function intended, but Phase 1 further needed to be accredited by the Air Force. Engineering Studies, Investigations, Tests, Evaluations & Consultations: The project include survey, geotechnical investigation, and cultural resources assess- ment. Two potential National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligible archae- ological sites were identified and required protection along with animal and plant habitats. The humid, rainy climate also influenced our master plan/design criteria. Site Work, Utilities & Landscaping: Our design team of landscape architects and civil engineers worked with the existing site parameters to address needed site drainage and access for the buildings. We also worked to improve the exist- ing utility connections for increased resiliency.\\nof construction solicitations ☒ Construction cost estimates using\\nMII\\n☒ Geotechnical Studies ☒ Interior design services ☒ Asbestos, lead and PCB surveys\\nComprehensive planning & drawing reviews: Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools were used for the development of the construction documents, exte- rior facade studies and to develop and evaluate several sustainable alternative design solutions and cost models for the exterior skin.\\nand/or abatement\\nCost:confidential.

A Project Planning Document Char- rette (PPDC) was conducted to gather/confirm scope requirements and criteria relevant to the RTI and support facilities, establish a revised DD Form 1390/91 with exceptions to criteria, and develop Master Plan Concepts. Analysis of the preliminary parametric estimate resulted in a phased construction strategy, which is not part of the DoD Pricing Guide. Jacobs further developed the DoD Pricing Guide model to include the associated costs of phasing the construction. Jacobs determined that the project needed to be phased to fit within the programmed amount. Each phase needed to be “complete and useable” for the function in- tended, but Phase 1 further needed to be accredited by NGB. Jacobs met that challenge and was able to help the FL ARNG get Phases I, II, III and IV awarded. Engineering Studies, Investigations, Tests, Evaluations & Consultations: The project include survey, geotechnical investigation, and cultural resources assess- ment. Two potential National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligible archae- ological sites were identified and required protection along with animal and plant habitats. The humid, rainy climate also influenced our master plan/design criteria. Comprehensive planning & drawing reviews: Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools were used for the development of the construction documents, exte- rior facade studies and to develop and evaluate several sustainable alternative de- sign solutions and cost models for the exterior skin.\\nCost:$56.8M.

The end user’s preferred option in most cases consistently exceeded the CCL. Kenall led a review of de- sired changes vs. changes that can be incorporated due to CCL limitations. The final selected option met the CCL and end user needs. Performed review / research of historical data to determine existing features, con- ditions, and utility locations. Performed extensive site investigations with end user interviews. Provided structural assessment of the wind / seismic lateral load- ing on posts / anchoring. Site Work, Utilities & Landscaping: Following verification of existing utilities, new infrastructure requirements and points of connection to service the buildings were determined. Domestic Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Natural Gas lines were sized to handle project loads and then terminate into existing mains. Privatized utility requirements were identified. Storm Drainage and Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan were provided based on the proposed site plan and coordinated with Installation personnel to define local requirements. Some of the buildings required LID development which consisted of necessary grading and drainage new roof downspouts tying into the existing underground drainage structures. Some of the sustainable design concepts included demolition of unwanted\\nSTANDARD FORM 330 (REV. 7/2021)\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nvarious features of multiple buildings.

We will also leverage our team’s experience working in all states within AOR, at all major military installations within AOR, and our long history of working with USACE. The depth and experi- ence of our AOR-based staff reduces costs, maximizes responsiveness, enhances project execution across multi- ple TOs, strengthens knowledge of local conditions, and ensures continuity across project sites, reducing perfor- mance risk to USACE. Exhibit H-20 illustrates our depth/breadth of key personnel and other technical/ad- ministrative support staff within AOR and throughout the US to support this contract. It also conveys the num- ber of registrations/certifications these staff offer, includ- ing PEs by specific engineering discipline. Our 58 key personnel along with other resources of our team, pro- vides the necessary capacity to deliver staff on day one of the contract, including support functions such as CADD/BIM technicians, specification writers, sched- ulers, procurement staff, etc.\\nUpon TO award, our PgM will assign a PM who devel- ops a staffing/resource plan for the TO, based upon the TO schedule, to define staffing and resource require- ments and uses our management systems to project, track, monitor, analyze, and control staffing levels. The PgM and PM will select staff from our initial core team supplemented by additional staff as needed. Project staffing plans are rolled up to a program-level, master schedule to allow the PgM to perform resource leveling and identify efficiencies across TOs. Our management\\nteam reviews 3-week look-ahead forecasts and staffing utilization reports from our management systems to en- sure staff are deployed efficiently and are available for future work. To monitor staffing utilization, our PMs participate in weekly resource meetings with our PgM to ensure resources are available. Our PgM will plan and schedule staff so we can retain our core team and pre- serve site knowledge and continuity on each project.\\nTo support staffing surges or to obtain specialty exper- tise, our team also has access to more than 63,890+ staff nationwide. We can obtain insights on best practices and technologies from thousands of staff, including 100+ subject matter experts (SMEs) with expertise in sustaina- bility, security/communications systems, NEPA compli- ance, storm water and site drainage, hydrology/hydraulic assessment, and other specialty areas. To facilitate multi- ple TO execution, our team also has significant manage- ment capabilities/tools, including our cost estimating ca- pabilities and experience with MII; scheduling systems, including both P6 and MS-Project; PM Dashboard for tracking cost/ schedule, QC Portal for organizing and sharing QC data, lessons learned database for capturing and deploying lessons learned, and our prequalified ven- dor database for quick identification of local and spe- cialty subcontractors. Additionally, our team provides technical capabilities and tools to facilitate multiple TOs, including Design Centers with AutoCAD, Revit BIM, and all types of design software (e.g., Civil3D, InRoads, OpenRoads, etc.); design review checklists, access to SpecsIntact, ProjNet, DrChecks; H&H modeling soft- ware; materials testing capabilities, etc.\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nH(C).2 Internal Controls and Procedures\\nFor this contract, SAI-Kenall JV will serve as the prime contractor and our PgM will be the single POC to Jack- sonville District Contracting, maximizing control and coordination across multiple TOs. The JV will retain program/project management, QC, project controls, and procurement, and will remain accountable for\\n.\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nperformance. We will manage all TOs under the direc- tion of our Program Manager, Kris Prasad, PE, and in close collaboration with our PMs, USACE and other key stakeholders, to facilitate work planning and execution, communication lines/reporting, and cost, schedule, and quality enforcement\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nH(C).2.1 Project Scheduling\\nSAI-Kenall PMs employ scheduling practices that incorporate proven delivery processes to track and monitor A-E activities to meet deliverable schedules. PMs use Microsoft Project or Primavera (P6) to develop TO schedules, listing due dates for deliverables and periods for QC review prior to delivery, and to track milestones in real time. Our PMs prepare schedules by identifying schedule risks/constraints, incorporating lessons learned, and assign backup staff to allow float and contingency, enhancing our ability to deliver resources to meet project schedules.\\nDuring the site visit, we assess facility conditions/issues and identify any additional scope issues. We incorporate subcontractors’ inputs into our schedule so there is adequate time for integration of activities as well as\\nH(C).2.2 Cost Estimating and Control\\nFor this contract, SAI-Kenall JV included large business subcontractor with multiple estimators and engineers on our team to support cost estimating—Jacobs—ensuring we can adequately respond to multiple task orders. Ja- cobs have 259+ cost engineers and 317+ cost estimators, including 300 with various cost certifications (CCE, CCC, CCP). Additionally, Jacobs and SVS also provides value engineering services to identify potential cost sav- ings across projects.\\nTo develop the cost estimate, the estimator focuses on verifying the scope provided in the solicitation and iden- tifying any out-of-scope elements along with any poten- tial risks that could impact the Construction Cost Limit (CCL). Through discussions with USACE and stake- holders, we gather input on final scope and design ex- pectations and other key cost drivers. Estimators, work- ing with the PM, develop the WBS to determine re- sources required (labor, materials, equipment, subcon- tracts, ODCs, travel, indirect expenses, and fee) to ad- dress the level of effort (LOE) and prepare the project budget.\\nSAI-Kenall JV ensure costs remain within the CCL by preparing a parametric estimate at the 35% design re- view to set guidelines for different cost elements. At the 65% design review, we conduct a formal reverification\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\ngovernment/regulatory review times. We identify the critical path and flag any other activities requiring special attention, such as long-lead items. Through kickoff meetings, design coordination meetings, formal design reviews, and routine project communications, PMs monitor progress against schedule to determine if there are any potential issues. If the PM encounters unforeseen schedule changes due to funding, regulatory delays, or changed conditions, the PM determines the impact to the schedule and assesses ways to mitigate them, including implementing workarounds, fast tracking the schedule, or reallocating resources. The PM is also responsible to ensure our design team conducts independent technical reviews (ITRs) and responds to reviewers comments following each design submittal to meet the schedule set for each milestone.\\nthat all systems, building materials, and constructability still meet the CCL. Finally at the 95% design re- view/100% RTA, we confirm that the design meets the CCL and end-user needs by recommending alternate so- lutions, value engineering, and/or creatively structuring “optional” bid items. We also get construction staff en- gaged in our later reviews to enhance constructability, cost accuracy, and buildability.\\nTo control our own A-E design costs, our PM will up- load the approved budget to our cost accounting system and work with our project controls staff to accumulate, track, and monitor costs and the actual progress of the work at the WBS activity level. These costs are captured in cost reports, which are electronically down-loaded so cost/schedule data can be updated and compared against the budget. Subcontractor cost data and progress records are collected at the same level of detail as our own costs, providing integrated cost reports. On a biweekly basis (or more frequently if needed for larger or more complex projects), our PM will reconcile costs incurred with ac- tual costs through our cost accounting system. The PM will also evaluate actual versus planned progress and will identify any variances, identify/evaluate corrective action alternatives and recommend future measures to deliver services to ensure completion of TOs within budget/schedule requirements.\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nH(D) DESIGN QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN (DQMP)\\nThe SAI-Kenall JV has an established DQMP that in- cludes policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities of the design team to ensure deliverables satisfy USACE requirements and cover all facets of the project from in- ception to completion. The DQMP also incorporates SOPs to guide work execution, including:\\nDesign analysis \\uf0b7 CADD standards \\uf0b7 Engineering calculations \\uf0b7 Engineering drawings/review \\uf0b7 Design review procedures \\uf0b7 Specifications review/checking \\uf0b7 Comment incorporation \\uf0b7 Change control for engineering documents \\uf0b7 Submittal tracking\\nWe ensure the design is complete for all construction ac- tivities and that our standard procedures are followed, including engineering calculations, calculation checking, drawing review, comment incorporation (RFI tracking), and specification checking. Technical discipline leads perform QC reviews for their respective disciplines at design milestones, 35/65/95/100% phases, using disci- pline checklists to ensure consistency. We conduct coor- dination checks at each design milestone, which are fo- cused interdisciplinary peer reviews as well as ITRs to coordinate design disciplines and enhance technical ade- quacy of documents. Client reviews are performed at each major milestone or per USACE request, comments\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nare reviewed and agreed upon and incorporated into sub- sequent design phases. We use DrChecks as our design review and checking system to track review comments and back-check to ensure their incorporation into the de- sign.\\nFor each TO, the PM provides record-keeping and docu- ment management for submittals and implements config- uration control to avoid issues. SAI-Kenall also has proven processes for ensuring design QC for subcontrac- tors. We partner with our subcontractors to provide ef- fective services-products and involve them in work plan- ning, so they obtain a sense of ownership and understand the impact their performance has on cost/schedule. We define their roles/responsibilities, outline expectations, and provide examples for reports and submittals.\\nOur PM and QC Manager require our subcontractors to follow our quality plan. Our PM enhances integration and coordinates weekly or biweekly meetings/confer- ence calls during TO execution to discuss schedules, is- sues, resources, and QC activities. Subcontractors sub- mit completed QC documents for each phase submittal per the approved QC Plan. Our QC Manager reviews the subcontractor’s QC documents for completeness and work products for contradictions/discrepancies, imple- ments corrective actions as needed, and looks for ways to improve processes. Exhibit H-21 provides an over- view of our design QC process and approaches for man- aging key design tasks.\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nThe following subsections provide additional details on our QC program, process, implementation, and personnel respon- sibilities that SAI-Kenall JV has established under DQMP process.\\nH(D).1 Quality Control Program\\nThe SAI-Kenall JV has an established QC program that includes policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities to ensure design deliverables satisfy UASACE require- ments and cover all facets of the project from inception to completion. Our program/procedures are ISO 9001- certified for Quality Management and ISO 14001-certi- fied for Environmental Management. Our procedures are incorporated into our Quality Management Plan (QMP) that provides the framework for planning, establishing quality measures, monitoring performance, enforcing quality measures, and achieving continuous improve- ment to ensure consistent execution that meets client standards or guidelines across multiple TOs. Our TO Manager, QC Manager, and quality support staff imple- ment our QMP and monitor quality indicators using de- fined processes to enhance results.\\nOur QC Program is vertically integrated into our project processes with key responsibilities assigned to specific project roles. The Program/Project Manager, supported by the JV Management Committee, is responsible for the overall project implementation and quality. Our Quality\\nControl Manager oversees QC Program enforcement, ensures the technical accuracy of project deliverables, coordinates with ITRs, and monitors project reviews to ensure compliance with the program. Our Task Order Manager provides the day-to-day oversight of the QC Program on each TO. He is responsible for communi- cating and coordinating project requirements and activi- ties and maintaining proper documentation of quality processes. Our designers, engineers, and checkers are re- sponsible for preparing accurate and appropriate work products that include all necessary and required QC doc- umentation demonstrating the product has been prepared IAW all TO requirements. H(D).1.1 Quality Control Process Chart Showing In- terrelationship of Management and Team Compo- nents Our quality organization promotes integration and con- sistency that is driven by our quality management team and infused through our internal design staff and subcon- tractors to deliver accurate and complete deliverables. Our quality group maintains a reporting relationship to our JV Management Committee that is independent from\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\noperations to ensure integrity, focus on quality, and avoid conflicting priorities. However, our quality group also works hand in hand with our management team to enforce quality and to improve project performance. As illustrated in Exhibit H-22, our quality control process is led by our QC Manager to provide direction/oversight on QC issues, involves our ITR teams to enhance design quality, and ensures our subcontractors follow all aspects of our design quality processes.\\nProject Planning—Soon after contract award, the JV will establish a DQCP that addresses USACE require- ments such as guidelines for drawings, technical specifi- cations, and design analyses. The DQCP will designate quality roles/responsibilities and identify QA/QC activi- ties and milestones to ensure the development of coordi- nated de-signs for both internal staff/subs. To ensure consistency in designs and streamline design reviews, the JV will develop and adopt a common set of standards and specifications that will apply across all projects. The JV will also engage with end users and subcontractors early in the process so decisions reached can be incorpo- rated into the design.\\nQC Coordination—Prior to submittal to USACE, the JV will conduct an interdisciplinary peer review to check\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nfor inconsistencies and harmonize deliverables. A disci- pline counterpart from the firm not preparing the design will review deliverables and consider standards, codes, and regulations applied and document findings on a checklist.\\nIndependent Technical Reviews—Following interdis- ciplinary reviews, senior-level, registered staff who are independent of the design team will conduct ITRs. Re- viewers will identify any deficiencies and document them in DrChecks to be resolved by the design team. The Design Manager will verify comments captured in DrChecks are back checked, review deliverables against the contract requirements, and ensure that a final QA re- view is per-formed on documents prior to submittal to NAVFAC. Continual Improvement—The JV will conduct peri- odic self-assessments and independent analyses to en- sure the technical quality of work products and the proper operation of the quality system. The JV’s Design Manager will monitor corrective actions to assess whether problems have been appropriately resolved.\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nH(D).2 QC Personnel, Other Responsibilities The SAI-Kenall JV recognizes that our QC program is integral to successful project implementation.

He also facilitates design QC activities and oversees the checkers to ensure they are performing required ac- tions\\nProject Manager – Project Manager will be respon- sible for planning, quality/safety oversight, budget and schedule management, recordkeeping, and com- pliance to contract and USACE requirements. Ex- hibit H-23 outlines specific reporting relationships and responsibilities for key staff on this contract. While key staff verify that the QC Program delivers accurate documents, all personnel are responsible for implementation.\\nH(D).3 Ability to Manager, Coordinate and Work Effectively with Team\\nSAI-Kenall JV has an established, integrated set of oper- ating procedures, which are documented in our JV Oper- ating Plan, to ensure effective execution. Our Program Manager has decision-making authority for the JV and the contract will be led and controlled under his leader- ship. Our JV will also use a common WBS framework for cost estimating, reporting, and invoicing, which will be rolled up to the JV cost structure for streamlined re- porting to USACE.\\nAdditionally, Kenall has provided Singhofen with access to our cost accounting system (partitioned for the JV) along with training to ensure consistent cost tracking/ac- counting.\\nSAI-Kenall JV has developed a team member manage- ment system that is based on the concept that work per- formance is a process that can be planned, performed, assessed, and improved. This system means we are posi- tioned and have the right tools to serve USACE on mul- tiple engagements in multiple areas concurrently. Team\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nmembers are used to augment SAI-Kenall JV technical expertise and will be selected based on best value to USACE. Best value determinations include cost, tech- nical capabilities and experience, schedule performance, quality practices, personnel expertise/availability, and re- sponsiveness. While team members may perform dis- crete tasks, SAI-Kenall retains control of project man- agement, the project schedule, and quality throughout TO performance period\\nTeam members are assigned discrete and measurable work elements defined by a written SOW that is pre- pared by the Project Manager and the Contracts Man- ager. Team members are accountable for budget, deliver- ables, project safety, schedule, and quality. We have es- tablished roles/responsibilities for team members in- volvement to ensure effective design and construction phase services throughout the TO lifecycle, as shown in Exhibit H-24.\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nOur Project Manager coordinates with team members through four phases of each TO—proposal prepara- tion/submittal, project planning, design development, and construction phase services/TO closeout. During the proposal preparation phase, our team reviews the SOW and design requirements, conducts site visit(s) as needed, and develops the design approach for USACE’s evaluation. Upon TO award, we conduct meetings, in- cluding the design charrette, and prepare project plans to establish performance targets related to scope and sched- ule and ensure design requirements are clearly identified and aligned. During design development, our Project Manager/Design Manager conduct project status meet- ings and written status reports to ensure work is proceed- ing in accordance with our Project Work Plan. This phase involves final deliverable production and inde- pendent technical reviews (ITRs) to verify that delivera- bles contain valid assumptions, designs, technical con- clusions, and complete submittal packages.\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nAt the 95% design phase, we conduct value engineering and constructability reviews to enhance construction ef- ficiencies. Finally, during construction phase services, we review construction submittals, respond to RFIs, and support construction inspections/testing, startup, com- missioning, and O&M support as required.\\nTo enhance coordination throughout the TO lifecycle, our JV applies established communication interfaces, en- hancing our ability manage and control design activities and other work required across our team members.\\nThrough kickoff meetings, design coordination meet- ings, formal design reviews, and routine project commu- nications, our Project Manager monitors progress against schedule to determine if there are any potential issues.\\nWe will manage all TOs under the direction of our Pro- gram/Project Manager, Kris Prasad, and in close collab- oration with our Project Manager, USACE, and other key stakeholders, to facilitate work planning and execu- tion, communication lines/reporting, and cost, schedule, and quality enforcement.

These costs are cap- tured in cost reports, which are electronically down- loaded so cost/ schedule data can be updated and com- pared against the budget. Subcontractor cost data and progress records are collected at the same level of detail as our own costs, providing integrated cost reports.\\nOn a biweekly basis (or more frequently if needed for larger or more complex projects), our Project Manager will reconcile costs incurred with actual costs through our cost accounting system. The Project Manager will also evaluate actual versus planned progress and will identify any variances, identify/evaluate corrective ac- tion alternatives, and recommend future measures to de- liver services to ensure completion of TOs within budget/schedule requirements.\\nof ownership and understand the impact their performance has on cost/schedule. We define their roles/responsibili- ties, outline expectations, and provide examples for re- ports and submittals. Our Project Manager and QC\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nManager require our subcontractors to follow our QMP and Design Quality Management Plan (DQMP). Our Pro- ject Manager coordinates with subcontractors through phases of TO-planning, project implementation, and re- porting. During the planning phase, meetings and project plans are prepared to establish performance targets related to scope and schedule and ensure data management re- quirements are clearly identified and aligned. During pro- ject implementation, project status meetings and written status reports provide the TO Manager with discrete\\nperformance metrics to facilitate cost/schedule tracking and management. The reporting phase involves final de- liverable production, QC review, and independent tech- nical re-views (ITRs). Our QC Manager reviews the sub- contractor\\'s QC documents for completeness and work products for contradictions/discrepancies, implements corrective actions as needed, and looks for ways to im- prove processes. This review is performed to verify that deliverables contain valid assumptions, designs, technical conclusions, and complete submittal packages.\\nH(E) PAST PERFORMANCE The SAI-Kenall team will minimize risk to the Jackson- ville District by providing an outstanding past perfor- mance record that is based upon our customer-driven corporate strategy. As illustrated in Exhibit H-26 (next page), JV members earned Exceptional and Very Good ratings on 25% of our CPARS, minimizing performance risk. Additionally, we have achieved a >90% repeat business rate and earned more than 50+ commendations. We are routinely recognized by clients for our superior performance and cost-efficient approaches. Similarly, our team members are highly sought-after firms, and all our experienced Fort Worth contractors who have excel- lent performance records (no subcontractors have any unsatisfactory CPARS ratings).\\nMany of these items are discussed during the charrette meeting with USACE and end users.\\nDuring execution, our PM monitors design performance to ensure objectives are being met and pulses customers to assess satisfaction. Our JV management committee conducts project reviews on a monthly basis to assess project performance across multiple task orders and to address any issues and areas for improvement. Follow- ing project completion, we conduct a lesson learned evaluation as part of project closeout. These lessons learned are communicated to project managers, QC staff, and key design staff to enhance performance on future task orders.\\nSAI-Kenall offers structured processes to assess perfor- mance throughout TO execution so we can proactively adjust/make improvements to maximize customer satis- faction. At the start of each project, our PMs define TO objectives, customer expectations, and expected results. We identify key success factors for the project and de- velop tactics for achievement. We also identify risks, de- velop risk mitigation strategies, and evaluate alternative solutions that could result in cost/schedule savings.\\nExhibit H-26 (next page) summarizes the SAI-Kenall JV’s past performance. In addition, Exhibit H-27 (next page) provides the additional past performance examples for quality of work, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/consumer satisfaction.\\nExhibit H-28 (below) summarizes the SAI-Kenall JV’s current relevant contracts and subcontract details.\\nExhibit 28: Current relevant contracts and subcontracts details\\nContract #\\nDoD Agency\\nPOC Name\\nEmail ID\\nAddress\\nW9126G17D0001\\nW9126G17D0017\\nW912BV20D0036\\nW912BV20D0024\\nW912EP-19-D-0019\\nW912EP-22-D-0005\\nUSACE Fort Worth\\nUSACE Tulsa USACE Jack- sonville USACE Jack- sonville\\nRobert Buchanan\\nDonna Jones\\nRonica Smith\\nMelissa Hyslop\\nRemi Eggers, Con- tract Officer Remi Eggers, Con- tract Officer\\nrobert.e.buchanan@usace.army.mil\\ndonna.l.jones@usace.army.mil\\nRonica.R.Smith@usace.army.mil\\nMelissa.D.Hyslop@usace.army.mil\\nremi.j.eggers@usace.army.mil\\nremi.j.eggers@usace.army.mil\\n819 Taylor St, CT OFC RM 2A17 Fort Worth, TX 76102 819 Taylor St, CT OFC RM 2A17 Fort Worth, TX 76102 819 Taylor St Taylor St, CT OFC RM 2A19 Fort Worth, TX 76102 2488 E. 81ST Street Tulsa, OK 74137 701 San Marco Blvd, Jacksonville, FL 32207 701 San Marco Blvd, Jacksonville, FL 32207\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nSolicitation Number: W912EP22R0042\\nPage 92\\nA-E Qualifications: Part I – Contract Specific Qualifications\\nExhibit H-27 SAI-Kenall JV Team Past Performance within the last 10 years\\nClient\\nContract/TO #\\nTitle of the Project\\nUSACE Fort Worth USACE Fort Worth\\nW9126G17D0017 W9126G17F0110\\nW9126G17D0011 W9126G17F0064\\nDesign of TEMF Complex Renovations, Fort Hood, TX\\nAE Services for Design Build Repair Building 6426, Hangar 3, for 11th Bomb Squadron, Barksdale AFB, LA\\nUSACE Fort Worth\\nW9126G17D0011 W9126G17F0049\\nRepair B499 A3 for Secure Operations, Randolph AFB, TX\\nUSACE Fort Worth\\nW9126G17D0011 W9126G17F0028\\nSustainability, Renovation and Modernization (SRM) and Combat Training Center (CTC) projects, Fort Polk, LA\\nUSACE Fort Worth\\nW9126G17D0017 W9126G17F0109\\nA-E Services for D-B RFP to repair BMT Recruit Housing & Training FAC B5570\\nUSACE Fort Worth\\nW9126G17D0011 W9126G18F0081\\nA-E Services for D-B-B RFP Red River Army Depot, Texar- kana, TX\\nUSACE Fort Worth\\nW9126G17D0017 W9126G17F0218\\nA-E Services for Complete Design JBSA/Fort Sam Houston -
