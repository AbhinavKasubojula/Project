      "[{'generated_text': \"Green underlined is add-in, Red strike through is deleted\\n\\nThis notice is posted in its entirety and hereby serves as the official solicitation\\nfor this project.\\n\\nCONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services will be procured in accordance with (IAW)\\n40 USC Chapter 11 Selection of Architects and Engineers (formerly known as Brooks\\nAct) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 to provide planning,\\ndesign, and engineering during construction primarily in support of the Civil Works\\nmission area within the SWG boundary and may be used for similar horizontal\\nengineering projects to support the Military and Interagency and International Support\\n(IIS) missions within the SWD area of responsibility (AOR). Capacity could be\\ntransferred outside the SWD AOR for high priority projects or emerging programs if\\ncapacity in other regions within the continental U.S. is inadequate.\\n\\nThis announcement is for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A-E\\nservices with a total shared capacity of $900M and includes a target of six (6)\\nUnrestricted A-E Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) and a target of six (6) separate\\nIDCs reserved for Small Business. The Government reserves the right to award more or\\nless than the target number of IDCs within the Unrestricted and Small Business IDC\\ngroups depending on the number of contractors considered highly qualified IAW Brooks\\nAct procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for\\nthis action is 541330 that has a small business size standard of $25.5 million.\\n\\nAll firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are\\nsubmitting.\\n\\nFirms should state the words UNRESTRICTED or SMALL BUSINESS after the\\nsolicitation number in PART I, Block A.3. of the SF330. As this is a single MATOC,\\nsmall business firms need only submit a single SF330.\\n\\nSelection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures but rather upon\\nthe professional qualifications necessary to perform the required services. Only firms\\nconsidered most highly qualified will be awarded a contract IAW 40 USC Chapter 11\\nSelection of Architects and Engineers statute, FAR Subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery\\nContracts, FAR Subpart 36.6 and DFARS Subpart 236.6 Architect-Engineer Services.\\nMultiple awards will be made from this solicitation. The contracts will be awarded for a\\nperiod not to exceed a total of eight (8) years, which includes a two (2) year base period\\nand three (3) two (2)-year options with the ability to extend the contract for a period of\\nup to six (6) months, if necessary, under FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend\\nServices. Work under this contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual\\n\\ntask orders with the total contract value of this procurement not to exceed\\n$900,000,000.00 over the eight-year life of the MATOC.\\n\\nThe Government will issue a rate sheet to the most highly qualified offerors and will\\nnegotiate fair and reasonable prices once, with an escalation rate to be applied every 12\\nmonths. There is no intent to include an economic price adjustment clause. Task Orders\\nwill be issued IAW USACE policy on procedures for the selection of Task Orders on A-E\\nMATOC IDCs. IAW FAR 19.504(c), all task orders, regardless of dollar value, will be\\nreviewed for a set-aside under the Small Business Reserve. Consistent with FAR\\n16.504(c)(1)(ii)(A), the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) has determined that it is in\\nthe Government's best interest that at all times during the term of the contract, there\\nremain an adequate number of IDC holders eligible to compete for Task Orders. Over\\ntime, the total number of IDC holders may fluctuate due to various reasons, to include\\nindustry consolidation, significant changes in the marketplace, significant advances in\\ntechnology, general economic conditions, or other reasons. Recognizing this, the PCO\\nintends to periodically review the total number of IDC holders and determine whether it\\nwould be in the Government's best interest to initiate on-ramp procedures to add new\\ncontractors to the MATOC pool consistent with the original target number of IDC\\nholders.\\n\\nTask Order types include Firm-Fixed Price, Cost-Plus Award Fee, Cost-Plus Fixed Fee,\\nTime and Materials, and Labor Hours. Task Order selection procedures will comply with\\nSection 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023. As this\\nMATOC includes a Small Business reserve pool, the qualifications of the reserve pool\\nmust first be considered for task order requirements. Firms will be required to\\ndemonstrate an acceptable accounting system. For clarification, this is NOT requesting\\nCost Accounting Standards (CAS) compliance from FAR part 30 or 48 CFR 9903.201.\\nThis is a separate but related requirement for an acceptable accounting system as\\nrequired by FAR parts 16 and 31 and specifically defined by DFARS 252.242-7006. All\\nofferors must have an acceptable accounting system to be awarded a contract. The\\nGovernment will not review or evaluate the accounting system; however, the following\\nitems will be accepted as evidence of an acceptable accounting system.\\n\\nA letter from a third party commercially recognized auditing firm within the last 12\\nmonths stating the accounting system is acceptable as required by DFARS 252.242-\\n7006; or\\n\\nA letter from a third party commercially recognized accounting firm within the last 12\\nmonths stating the accounting system is acceptable as required by DFARS 252.242-\\n7006; or\\n\\nAn audit of the accounting system from the Federal Government Cognizant Audit\\nAgency; (NOTE: if DCAA audit has been performed/approved over 12 months ago, a\\nstatement that the accounting has not changed since being approved would be\\nsufficient).\\n\\nAll firms will be required, at the base contract level and subsequently for each\\napplicable task order (other than Firm-Fixed Price), to have a certified cost accounting\\nsystem that will permit timely development of all necessary cost data IAW FAR Part 16.\\nPrior to award of the base IDC, all firms will be required to provide a current\\naudit/report/findings/letter and point of contact with phone number or e-mail address\\nfrom the offeror’s Federal Government Cognizant Audit Agency or any commercially\\nrecognized auditing or accounting firm stating that the offeror’s accounting system is\\nadequate for accumulating costs under the applicable Government contracts, if\\navailable. If it has been over twelve (12) months since the accounting system has been\\ndesignated as adequate, the offeror shall also provide a statement that the accounting\\nsystem has not changed since being approved.\\n\\nPROJECT INFORMATION: A-E services for this contract will be used to provide all\\ntypes of civil works related engineering areas, such as: flood damage and risk\\nreduction; floodplain modeling; coastal erosion; storm damage risk reduction and beach\\nnourishment; shoreline and stream bank erosion protection; shallow and deep draft\\nnavigation; environmental and ecosystem habitat restoration; comprehensive watershed\\nevaluations; infrastructure; and multi-purpose water resources projects. The capabilities\\nof A-E firms would include comprehensive planning, technical analysis, engineering,\\ndesign, and engineering during construction. Services include data collection,\\ngeotechnical investigations, surveying, preliminary studies through feasibility report\\ndevelopment; engineering design through detailed plans, specifications, and design\\nanalysis/design documentation report preparation; alternate delivery method (i.e.\\ndesign-build, progressive design-build, and early contractor involvement) request for\\nproposal development; value engineering; technical and biddability, constructability,\\noperability, environmental, and sustainability (BCOES) reviews; documentation for right\\nof entry and right of way; and engineering during construction for both inland and\\ncoastal civil works or similar horizontal projects for the military and IIS programs.\\nSELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of\\nimportance. Criteria A thru E are primary. Criterion F and G are secondary and will only\\nbe used as a tiebreaker among technically equal firms.\\n\\nA. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: A maximum of ten (10)\\nrelevant projects of the prime, the subcontractor(s), or both, will be reviewed in PART |,\\n\\nSection F of the SF330. Submitted projects shall be at least 50% completed within the\\npast fifteen (15) years from the date of issuance of the synopsis. Of these ten (10)\\nprojects, the Prime must have performed and completed a minimum of six (6) projects\\n(as the prime contractor, or designer of record). Joint Venture (JV) submissions shall\\nalso provide a minimum of six (6) projects; however, if the JV does not have the\\nminimum projects as a JV Offeror, then the Managing Venturer shall supplement to\\nmeet the minimum requirement of six (6) projects. Any project submitted by the JV as\\nprevious experience performed as the offeror, shall count toward the managing venturer\\nexperience.\\n\\nUse no more than two (2) pages per project. A project is defined as a project performed\\nunder a single, stand-alone contract and/or a single task order issued under an existing\\nIDC unless the project included multiple phases and was issued under more than one\\ncontractual order. It shall be noted that an IDC is not a project and will not be in\\ncompliance with the requirement. Do not combine multiple task orders unrelated to a\\nstand-alone project to create a single project example. The contract number or IDC\\nnumber and individual task order number associated with the project in the title must be\\nincluded for each of the projects. If the project is not 100% complete, note the current\\npercentage and estimated date when the project will be completed for each contract\\nand/or task order. All projects shall demonstrate a performance as the prime and/or\\ndesigner of record (DOR) and include the percentage of work self-performed by the\\nprime and subcontractor(s) for each contract and/or task order. Percentages shall be\\nlisted by firm individually. Preference will be given to projects performed as a prime\\ncontractor (or DOR) as opposed to subcontracted work. If proposing as a JV, include\\nthe percentage of work self- performed by each JV member. In the case of JV\\nsubmissions, preference will be given to JVs who have previously performed work\\ntogether as the prime contractor. Unique Entity Identification (UEI) and Commercial and\\nGovernment Entity (CAGE) codes for previous JVs shall be clearly indicated in the past\\nperformance, if UE] and CAGE codes are not provided, this experience will not be\\nconsidered to support a history of working together.\\n\\nFive (5) of the ten (10) projects shall be 100% complete design of which three (3) of the\\nfive (5) projects shall be 100% complete design with engineering during construction\\nthat specifically address the areas of emphasis listed below. Offerors shall ensure that\\nthe total combination of projects submitted address all five areas of emphasis. Offerors\\nshall annotate when individual projects address more than one area of emphasis.\\nAreas of Emphasis:\\n\\n(1) navigation structures (lock and dams, floodgates, etc.);\\n\\n2) floodwalls and closure structures;\\n\\n3) beaches, dunes, and coastal structures;\\n\\n4) dams and levees; and\\n\\n5) pump stations.\\n\\nProjects for federal agencies, USACE, or associated with USACE (such as work-in-kind\\nfor non-federal sponsors) will be MORE relevant, when all other aspects of the scope\\nare considered equal. Projects performed for clients other than federal agencies or\\nUSACE may be relevant if they address the area of emphasis. Preference will be given\\nto prime offerors that demonstrate the capability to self-perform a greater number of the\\nareas of emphasis without teaming arrangements. Self-Performance requirements will\\nbe evaluated IAW FAR Subpart 19.5 at the task order level. Less Relevance will be\\ngiven to projects submitted by subcontractor teaming partners. Projects presented to\\naddress the areas of emphasis shall be presented and identified in the order listed\\nabove. The remaining five (5) projects shall follow the area of emphasis projects.\\n\\nIn PART |, Section H, SF330 provide the following:\\n\\nA narrative describing (1) the firm’s partnering philosophy to develop and sustain\\nrelationships between the A-E, Government, and stakeholders (2) the firm’s approach to\\nprovide exceptional delivery measured by expedited delivery, lower construction costs,\\nand quality assurance. (3) The narrative shall describe design quality management\\nprocedures that optimize quality, limit re-submittals of incomplete work, and increase\\nefficiency of delivery. !fsubmitting-as-JV Describe procedures that will limit the need\\nfor reviews across multiple firms while maintaining a quality product. (4) Describe\\nprevious experience between team members as structured in the offeror’s current\\nproposed teaming arrangement. For example, if proposing as a JV, previous experience\\nin a prime and subcontractor relationship would not be relevant and vice versa. (5)\\nDescribe procedures for financial management and task order management. If\\nsubmitting as a JV, describe procedures for administering multiple task orders across\\nthe JV arrangement and how modification of task order management would ensure\\nefficiency within the JV.\\n\\nB. Professional Qualifications: The selected firm must have, either in-house or\\nthrough consultants, the disciplines listed below, with registration and board certification\\n(where available) required (include licensure, state/country, and certification numbers)\\nwhere applicable.

SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria are listed below in descending order\\nof importance. Criteria ‘a through e’ are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors.\\nCriteria f and g are secondary and will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that\\n\\nare essentially technically equal.\\n\\na.\\n\\n1\\n\\n~~\\n\\n~~\\n\\n~~\\n\\nSpecialized experience and technical competence in:\\n\\nDesigning facilities for a contingency environment to “initial” and “temporary”\\nstandards IAW UFC 1-201-01 “Non-Permanent DoD Facilities in Support of\\nMilitary Operations”. Familiarity with the Army Facilities Components System\\n(AFCS) and Joint Construction Management System (JCMS), and familiarity with\\nthe U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Design\\nManagement System (DMS) will be given greater consideration. Evaluation will\\nbe based on project descriptions in Section F of the SF 330.\\n\\nQuality management procedures. The basis of the evaluation will be the\\ndescription of the firm’s quality management procedures in Section H of the SF\\n330. A detailed quality control plan is not required with this submission but will\\nbe required subsequent to award of the contract.\\n\\nLeading design charrettes and conducting customer reviews. Evaluation will be\\nbased on project descriptions in Section F of the SF 330.\\n\\nFor sub-criteria a.1 and a.3, the basis of evaluation will be the project descriptions\\n\\nin Section F of the SF 330. For sub-criteria a.2, the basis of the evaluation will be\\n\\nthe description of the firm’s quality management procedures in Section H of the SF\\n330. Sub-criteria are in descending order of importance, a.3 is less important than\\na.2 and a.2 is less important than a.1.\\n\\nb. Professional Qualifications: Responding firms should demonstrate the\\n\\nprofessional qualifications in these key disciplines:\\n\\nProject manager\\nArchitect\\n\\nStructural engineer\\nMechanical engineer\\nElectrical engineer\\nCivil engineer\\n\\nYS a\\n\\n(1\\n(2\\n(3\\n(4\\n(5\\n(6\\n\\nAdditional disciplines required as part of the contract that will not be evaluated\\ninclude: Data modeler (i.e. data entry technician).\\n\\nThe basis of evaluation will be information provided in section E of the SF 330. The\\nSF 330 shall include a matrix in Section G showing experience of the proposed lead\\ndisciplines on the projects listed in Section F of the SF 330. The qualifications\\n(education, professional registration, certifications) and experience (overall and\\nrelevant experience, longevity with the firm) will be considered. Qualified\\nprofessionals with active duty military or civilian experience in a contingency\\nenvironment will be given greater consideration. All disciplines are equal in\\n\\nimportance. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key\\npersonnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed\\nunder the capacity criterion below. The lead personnel for each discipline should be\\nclearly identified in section E. Only one resume (the lead for that discipline) will be\\nevaluated for each discipline.\\n\\nc. Past Performance\\n\\nRecent and relevant past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to\\ncost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be\\nconsidered. The Contract Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the\\nprimary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all\\nfirms submitting a SF 330. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board,\\nperformance evaluations for any significant teaming partners/subcontractors who\\nhave previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered. Significant\\nteaming partners/subcontractors are those firms whose qualifications are being used\\nin Section F projects. In addition to CPARS, the board may seek information on past\\nperformance from other sources. If no recent or relevant performance record is\\navailable, or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful\\nconfidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror will receive a\\nneutral evaluation. A neutral rating is considered neither a positive nor negative.\\n\\nd. Knowledge of local conditions. Not used.\\n\\ne. Capacity to initiate work and complete within the time parameters of the\\nproject.\\n\\nThe evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in\\nthe following key disciplines: project manager, architects, mechanical engineers,\\nelectrical engineers, civil engineers, structural engineers. The evaluation will look at\\nnumbers listed in Part II of the SF330 to evaluate the overall capacity of the team.\\nInclude a Part II form for each firm that is part of the proposed team.\\n\\nSecondary Selection Criteria. The following secondary criteria will only be used as a\\ntie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criteria will\\nnot be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary\\nselection criteria are listed in descending order of importance.\\n\\nf. Volume of DoD AE contract awards in the last 12 months.\\n\\nResponding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications,\\naward dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD AE contract awarded within the\\npast twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable\\ndistribution of DoD AE contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation\\nwill be information submitted in Section H of the SF 330.\\n\\n4. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform\\n\\nthis work must submit one Standard Form (SF) 330 electronic copy using the\\ninstructions for the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) below no\\nlater than 1:00 PM Central Standard Time on 30 May, 2024.

A “project” is defined as work performed\\nat one site or a single installation. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) will not be\\nconsidered a “project” for the purposes of evaluation. Individual Task Order contracts\\nawarded from an IDC contract will only be considered as a single project, regardless of\\nthe number of facilities and/or the range of the scope of work (i.e. a single Task Order\\ncontract cannot be submitted as multiple projects for the submission requirements in\\nthis synopsis). If the offeror provides a specific task order as a project, it should provide\\nthe base contract number and the task order number for reference purposes. If the\\nofferor provides a site-specific contract as a project, it should provide the contract\\nnumber for reference purposes. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work\\nperformed by the team, extent of design completed (for instance, preparation of design-\\nbuild package; 100% design; etc.), dates of completion for design and construction, and\\nproject category type (new/ renovation). Clearly cite whether the experience is that of\\nthe prime (or joint venture), consultant or an individual for each project in Section F.\\nWork cited that is experience of the prime (or joint venture) from an office other than\\nthat identified in Section C should be so labeled. Projects (or phases of projects) with\\ndesign completed before May 2018 will not be considered. Projects (or phases of\\nprojects) for which design is not complete will not be considered.\\n\\nFirms may demonstrate additional experience with projects similar to the requirements\\nlisted in section 2 by providing a project summary list or matrix within Section H.
